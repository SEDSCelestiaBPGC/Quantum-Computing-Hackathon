    "Quantum Coputation is an up and coming field that uses quantum gates to perform operations which exploit properties of a quantum state like superposition, and entanglement to perform computations. The aim is to solve computation problems in executable time that might not be solvable using its classical analogue. In this hackathon, we will be introducing you to challenges of different difficulty levels. \n",
